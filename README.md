Getting and Cleaning Data
=========================

The purpose of this project is to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
In this repo you will find:
* Script for performing the analysis
* Code Book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that is performed to clean up the data.

The data used to perform the analysis represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
